=====================================

Boolean true:
{{include "included_bool.tpro", flag = true}}

Boolean false:
{{include "included_bool.tpro", flag = false}}

Float:
{{include "included_float.tpro", num = 3.14}}

Negative integer:
{{include "included_int.tpro", num = -42}}

Expression:
{{include "included_int.tpro", num = @(intvalue10 * 2)}}

Multiple mappings:
{{include "included_multi.tpro", a = "AAA", b = :value2, c = 123}}
